## Intro

***Who is the Dan?*** </br>
 You have him here, welcome to the place of truth I am *the* Dan and I'll be your guide around here. I am 21 and currently an intern in a Romanian company working as a web developer. Psychology degree, self-taught, better said *internet-taught* and that's all the relevant info, some links to *some* socials provided below.

 - [Github](https://github.com/Dan-Lucian)

***Why trust this Dan fella?*** </br>
Yes, that's the neat part, you don't. I'm not here to hold your hand, nor to reveal some sacred secrets, nor claiming to know much, nor claiming to have the most comprehensive guide out there, nor... I think you get the idea. This is just a review of *my* web dev road, I repeat *MY ROAD*, with some improvements that I think would have smoothed out the sharp corners of my path and made it a bit shorter. Ideally you will move out from this guide and follow lots of other guides of a much better quality.

***What to expect of this dude's guide?*** </br>
Links, a lot of links, like really a lot of them. I am not planning on re-writing the damn wikis and I never will. If you are not able to keep up, read blogs and docs, watch videos and develop the skill of searching the internet and distinguishing good resources from bad ones I think you just won't make it as a dev. The internet is stoopid big which is nice and not so nice. Lots of quality resources out there and also lots of poor ones as well. I am going to share here my personal best since I'm feeling that nice today.

And also there will be some *tIpS aNd TrIcKs* sprinkled here and there which are not mandatory but helped or would have helped me greatly.

***Man it's too much and I don't feel like reading..*** </br>
What you doing here then? Go watch some YouTube and get yourself stuck in the tutorial hell. You *will* have to read eventually be it blogs, docs or other guides but the time will have been wasted, make your future self a favour and start reading now.

***Is it yet another guide?*** </br>
Indeed it is *yet* another guide. Fight me bro.

**You read everything up till here?** </br>

 - yes? Good, I sense learning potential within you. Keep it up like this and you're golden. 
 - no? You're doing it wrong, what do you even expect to get out of a *written* guide without reading it, go back :(

***P.S.*** Have a question? Open an issue. Have an improvement idea? Open an issue. Anything else? OPEN AN ISSUE. Feeling sick? Go get yourself checked.

***Studying***
 - [Lecture about effective studying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0&t=604s):
	 - go watch it now, spend that hour and save yourself thousands in the future.
	 - finished it? watch it again it is really that essential for a solid starting point.
	 - adopt as many tactics as you can.
- grow the discipline within you and be consistent:
	-  1h x 6 > 5h x 1 *always*.
- keep track of how many hours you study a day (img here):
	- having a recorded history of your learning sessions will show you the harsh and often unpleasant reality of how much time you actually spent studying per day and also per week.
	- we humans often overestimate how much time we spent studying by quite the margin. I know it, I've done it.
	- having the history will motivate you to continue just because you had the hours the day before and you will start feeling bad if you start missing days.
- have a break day:
	- on this day you don't do anything related to code.
	- working tirelessly is the cause of early quitters.
	- I had Wednesday as my free day because Saturday and Sunday were the days I had the most free time to put into studying.
- sleep *damn* well:
	- c'mon, you know it, I don't have to tell you this.
	- be a good boi and sort that sh*t out.
	- do some research on the topic or something and sort it out.
- learn to use [Evernote](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052560314-Install-an-older-version-of-Evernote):
	- its a great note taking app that gets the job done.
	- you can record there anything from code and theory to learning sessions and personal stuff.
	- the link points to the *legacy* version of the app which in my opinion is much better because the new one is heavy and gets quite laggy once you have 100+ notes. Don't worry you'll get there as well.


## Roadmaps

> Roadmaps are nice. 
> @me

**Front-end development**
 - [the roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).
 - this roadmap should be your main learning guide. 
 - you will have to go through all the topics there, starting the from the basic topics and advance to the more complex ones.
 - anytime you question yourself what to study next go and take a look at it.
 - at the moment of writing this, I myself am at the "Type Checkers" level.

**Other**
 - [various roadmaps](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).
 - don't know much about these but they look nice.
